### Main Functions

- asks for string to find
- asks for replacement string
- asks for target directory
- asks for backup directory and creates backup before running
- runs script

> NOTE: <br>
> Because we tried our best to make this script crossplatform, you will need homebrew and tkinter installed on MACOS.
> This script will try to install these dependencies automatically if your detected OS is MACOS.
> Simply escape the script if you do not wish to continue when the countdown starts.

### ROADMAP

- adds the option to choose to replace strings in filenames or files
- prompts the user to choose y/n before installing MACOS dependencies
- fix MACOS bug when choosing backup directory as "back"
